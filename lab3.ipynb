    "1. **Random Forest:** Around 85-89% accuracy.\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Around 85-90% accuracy, depending on kernel and hyperparameters.\n",

    "Keep in mind these numbers are approximate and can vary based on the exact preprocessing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning you do. In general, deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), tend to perform better on image classification tasks like Fashion-MNIST, potentially reaching over 90-95% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for classic machine learning models, anything in the 85-90% range can be considered a reasonable result for the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It reflects a model that has learned something meaningful from the data but isn't necessarily state-of-the-art for this particular task."

    "Locust.io is an open-source load testing tool written in Python. It allows you to define user behaviour with Python code and simulate millions of simultaneous users to bombard a system with traffic to test its resilience under heavy load. The (locustfile.py)[./locustfile.py] script re-uses the logic in step #6 to query pinecone. It has a custom event hook that denotes a failure if the top_k result set does not match the search image description. This script will likely fail with a low error rate but you can increase top_k to get a 100% pass rate. The locust summary includes P50 to P100 response time percentiles and QPS(req/s)."
